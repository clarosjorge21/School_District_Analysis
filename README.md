### School District Analysis Summary

We are able to to constantly use this program and script with future elections by just changing a few things in the script. Below you can see two codes that are in the script that if we modify we are able to change the election data but continue to use the script.

By changing the file to load code we are able to change the election results from the one we are currently using to another one as long as it is in a csv and has a similar format as this one. In the second image, we need to change just like the first image because that is the csv that the script is reading. By changing this csv we are able to run our loops and produce the results for the next election.
